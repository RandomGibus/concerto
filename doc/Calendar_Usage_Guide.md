Using the Concerto calendar
In order to Display a calendar on Concerto, you need to export it into a .ics format
Currently, there are very few ways to get a .ics link. Here's one way that I've found that works
Create a calendar in outlook
Share it with a given email(make sure to allow the email to view the full calendar, not just availability)
check response email, there will be a link underneath the button to connect the two emails.
<img width="1567" height="688" alt="{D923B4E8-67D0-4F93-8430-D44701C6C3D6}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a194b707-152d-4afd-85de-013535549c3b" />
copy this hyperlink, and paste it into the upload page.

Make sure not to update the start or end dates. This will prevent the submission from going through.
