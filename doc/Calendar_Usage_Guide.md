Using the Concerto calendar
In order to Display a calendar on Concerto, you need to export it into a .ics format
Currently, there are very few ways to get a .ics link. Here's one way that I've found that works
Create a calendar in outlook
Share it with a given email(make sure to allow the email to view the full calendar, not just availability)
check response email, there will be a link underneath the button to connect the two emails.

copy this hyperlink, and paste it into the upload page.
Make sure not to update the start or end dates. This will prevent the submission from going through.
